# Habit Tracker App ðŸ“…

A simple Flutter app designed to help users track and visualize their daily habits. The app enables users to create custom habits, track progress over time, and maintain streaks for added motivation.

This project was created to learn **Flutter** and **Dart**.

## Features

- **Custom Habit Creation**: Add and edit habits with custom names and colors.
- **Daily Tracking**: Mark your habits as completed each day and see a calendar overview of your progress.
- **Habit Streaks**: Maintain streaks by consistently completing habits to stay motivated.
- **(Planned)** **Streak Freezes**: Get rewarded if you complete your habits often enough in a row or meet other criteria, earning streak freezes (allowing you to maintain streaks even if you miss one day).
